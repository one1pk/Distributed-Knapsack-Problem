# 0-1 Knapsack Problem
First run `make` in the root directory before proceeding.
## Generating Input
An input file can be generated by entering the following command in the root directory:
```
make generate_test_input0
```
There are 4 input files that can be generated, for which you can just change the `0` in the command above to correspond to your choice. The number of items in each choice are as follows:
- input0 : 500
- input1 : 1000
- input2 : 10000
- input3 : 50000

The input file will get saved in the `input_files` directory, with the name `input.in`.
Only one input file can exist at a time - the existing file gets replaced everytime a new one is generated.

## Run the program
### Serial version
The serial version only takes in an *optional* `capacity` parameter to set the maximum capacity of the knapsack.
```
./knapsack_serial --capacity <MAX_CAPACITY>
```
### Parallel version
The parallel version takes in an additional *optional* `threads` parameter to set the number of threads.
```
./knapsack_parallel --capacity <MAX_CAPACITY> --threads <NUM_THREADS>
```
### Distributed version
The distributed version only takes the *optional* `capacity` parameter. The number of processes can be set as an MPI flag.
```
mpirun -n <NUM_PROCESSES> ./knapsack_mpi --capacity <MAX_CAPACITY>
```
